## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run
    
## Description

Framework to provide authentication/authorization to backend servers.
    
## Subsystem vs. Service

Rampart's definition of service is an api server providing services,
disregarding how well partitioned the api server is.

A subsystem is a set of functionality. Ideally a subsystem has a
one-to-one correspondence with a service. However, particularly
when a system is evolving, the services may not be completely or
correctly partitioned/normalized. Also, there are cases where a
subsystem crosses service boundaries. For example, a price subsystem
may be both in an ecommerce service (i.e., can prices be shown on product
pages?) and a project management subsystem (can prices be shown on
order line items?)

## Process description

The central component is the system is this function:

```clojure
(defn process [query]
  (->>
   query
   prepare-query
   pre-validate
   pre-authorize
   process-request
   add-body-object
   post-validate
   post-authorize
   finalize-query
   format-response))
```
   
The query parameter is a map which is returned from each function, and in
turn passed to the next function. It starts with a :query key,
which is also a map, containing :subsystem, :query-name,
and :params keys.

The subsystem is a psuedo self-contained system that can operate independently.
Each subsystem will typically be instantiated in a service, but several subsystems
can be contained in a monolithic program.

Rampart itself is an example of a subsystem, as it owns the data used for it's
business rules. There are of course links from the customer-ids and account-numbers
in rampart to the full objects in another system, but rampart itself does not
access this other data.

The query-name refers to the query that is to be run on the backend server.
A definition of the query is associated with this query name.

Finally the params are parameters to be passed to the remote query.

Pre-authorize typically authorizes the :query values, while post-authorize
typically authorizes the body of response from the backend server.
